## 5. What is Node js?
(i) Before there was no way to use the javascript programming language outside of the browser to build things like web servers that could access the file system and 
connect to databases.
(ii) All of this ended up by changing with the introduction of node js.
(iii) Now JavaScript developers can use javascript in the server side -> web servers, command line interfaces, application back end and more.
(iv) Node js is a JavaScript runtime built o chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

                                                         \ /
                                              It recieves the JavaScript code and compile it down
                                              to machine code that machine can actually execute.
                                                          |
                                                         \ /
                                              It is written in C++ programming language
                                                         \ /
                                              That means any developers who write application in C++ can incorporate with V8 engine.
 Note : Node js is not a programming language
